An anonymous reader quotes a report from ZDNet:

  At the 2019 Linux Plumbers Conference, I talked to Linus Torvalds and
  several other of the Linux kernel's top programmers.  They universally
  agreed Microsoft wants to control Linux, but they're not worried about 
  it.[1]  That's because Linux, by its very nature and its GPL2 open-source
  licensing, can't be controlled by any single third-party.  Torvalds said:
  "The whole anti-Microsoft thing was sometimes funny as a joke, but not
  really.  Today, they're actually much friendlier.  I talk to Microsoft
  engineers at various conferences, and I feel like, yes, they have
  changed, and the engineers are happy.  And they're like really happy
  working on Linux.  So I completely dismissed all the anti-Microsoft
  stuff."

  But that doesn't mean the Microsoft leopard can't change its spots.  Sure,
  he hears, "This is the old Microsoft, and they're just biding their
  time."  But, Torvalds said, "I don't think that's true.  I mean, there
  will be tension.  But that's true with any company that comes into Linux;
  they have their own objectives.  And they want to do things their way
  because they have a reason for it."  So, with Linux, "Microsoft tends to
  be mainly about Azure and doing all the stuff to make Linux work well for
  them," he explained.  Torvalds emphasized this is normal: "I mean, that's
  just being part of the community."

James Bottomley, an IBM Research Distinguished Engineer and top Linux kernel
developer, sees Microsoft as going through the same process as all other
corporate Linux supporters:  "This is a thread that runs through Linux.
You can't work on the kernel to your own proprietary advantage.  A lot of
companies, as they came in with the proprietary business model, assumed they
could.  They have to be persuaded that, if you want something in Linux, that
will assist your business -- absolutely fine.  But it has to go through an
open development process.  And if someone else finds it useful, you end up
cooperating or collaborating with them to produce this feature."  That
means, to get things done, even Microsoft is "eventually forced to
collaborate with others."

Bottomley concluded:  "So it doesn't matter if Microsoft has a competing
agenda to Red Hat or IBM or anybody else.  Developers are still expected
to work together in the Linux kernel with a transparent agenda."

And you shouldn't be either.  Every company wants to rule Linux 
-- none of them can or ever will.
